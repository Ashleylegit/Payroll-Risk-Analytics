📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a payroll audit and risk analysis system designed to identify payroll errors, control weaknesses, and financial exposure risks using SQL analysis and Power BI dashboards.

The goal is to help organizations detect payroll inconsistencies, prevent financial leakage, and improve payroll compliance through data-driven reporting.

🎯 Business Objectives

This project focuses on:

Detecting payroll errors and anomalies

Identifying overtime abuse risks

Highlighting duplicate employee records

Flagging missing or inconsistent deductions

Quantifying financial exposure related to payroll risk

Visualizing payroll risk trends for management decision-making

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQLite — Payroll dataset querying

SQL — Audit logic, aggregations, risk calculations
